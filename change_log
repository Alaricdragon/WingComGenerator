V0.0.4:
    fixed broken detection on some different hull and variant types in the WingComGenerator.version
    fixed crash when opening cargo when a wingcom blueprint is in it. (NOT save combatable. remember to run the generator when starting a new save.)
    made variant names different from each other.
    added a tag to all generated wingcom units 'wingcomgenerator_bp'

base settings:
    base settings are settings that -can only be modified form this file- they are:
    "buildRestricted" (allows fighters yuo would never see to be generated, but not built in fleets)
    "spawnRestricted" (allows fighters you would never see to be built in fleets -if they are generated-)
addable settings:
    settings here can be added to from any mod with the WinComGenerator_Settings.json
    settings here are not overwritten, but instead merged together.
    "permaMods" hullmods added to all .ship files, regardless of other settings.
    "tags" tags added to all ship.csv files, regardless of other settings.
    "forceExclude" fighters that will be forcefully -not generated-
    "ignoreRestrictedStatus" fighters that will be allowed to generate, even though they would normally be prevented from doing so.
    "forceAllowSpawns" fighters that would be allowed to spawn in fleets, even though they normally would be prevented from doing so
    "forcePreventSpawns" forcefully prevents fighters from spawning in fleets, regardless of status.
overwritable settings:
    these are settings that can be overwritten by other mods, or added together. conditions will be explained in each item.
    "defaultShipData" anything inside of this can be overwriten, every indevidual section of this can be overwriten. as per the 'hull data and variant data information' page.
                      this is the hull and variant data that will be used by default.
    "manufacturerSettings" this holds a list of objects following the 'hull data and variant data information'.
                           the name of each object determines what ship manufacturer this apply to. all ships of this manufactuer have the set data overriding
                           effectively overrides 'defaultShipData' on a manufacturer by manufacturer bases
                           only one mod can edit a given manufacturer. if two or more mods are editing the same manufacturer, the one with the lowest load order is discarded.
    "fighterOverride" this holds a list of objects following the 'hull data and variant data information'
                       the name of each object determines the fighter ID that is being overwritten (in the fighters.csv file).
                       will override both 'manufacturer settings' and 'defaultShipData'
                       only one mod can edit a given fighter. if two or more mods are editing the same fighter, the one with the lowest load order is discarded.
hull data and variant data information:
    please keep in mind: hull and variant data are devided into sections. they are:
        "base"
        "shielded"
        "phased"
        "undefended"
        "other"
        "fighters":
            "base"
            "shielded"
            "phased"
            "undefended"
            "other"
        "bombers":
            "base"
            "shielded"
            "phased"
            "undefended"
            "other"
        "interceptors":
            "base"
            "shielded"
            "phased"
            "undefended"
            "other"
        "other":
            "base"
            "shielded"
            "phased"
            "undefended"
            "other"
        in this, 'base' is the fallback. if you just want to override everything to be the same, you use 'base'.
        the next 4 items are for defensive types. basicly, what defense this fighter has.
        the 'fighters', 'bombers', 'interceptors', 'other' are for the fighter 'types'. within each, you can chose between all possable defensive types.
        I might make this more flexible in the future, but I wanna play starsector.

    the 'hull' type:
        the hull type consists of two parts:
        1: the 'base data': (this is for CSV data mostly. its effectively the ships base stats.)
                            (the fighters also effects the .ship files and .variants files. but it does not matter)
                            (please keep in mind: any indevidual bit of data you set here will override that bit of data, and only that bit of data for any ships this appys to.)

        2: the .ship file: (as a literal .ship file. this is usefully for things like adding additional weapon slots onto the craft).
                           (please note: if the .ship file is set, it will overwrite, not add to, the base .ship file in its intierty.)
            - .ship
    the 'variant' type:
        this holds two things:
        1: the spawn weight and type:
            - spawnWeight:  the 'weight' of this to spawn in fleets
            - spawnGroup:   what 'group' this is placed into in the 'roles.json' file.
        2: the .variant data:
            this is a .variant file for a fighter.
            mostly used to set weapon data, and hull mods.
            - .variant
